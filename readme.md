# Avast!

A top down pirate themed survival/crafting game build using Phaser 3

## Bugs to fix

- Spawners are bugged sometimes, spawning way too many enemies
- Crafting menu bug after player embarks on ship
- Boarding enemy ships is bugged
- Player is still inside ship after dying, and cannot board a new ship

## Easy wins

- Make monkeys have drops, like pelts and bananas or something
- Give crab claws a function, like making them edible
- Add fish and sharks that swim around in the ocean

## Meatier Stuff

- Add "medium" ship between Brig and Sailboat
- Add animated flags to ships
- Make certain enemies automatically aggro the player

# Long Term stuff

- Add biomes
- Add NPCs and dialogue
- Add leveling / EXP system for different attributes

## Technical Debt Roadmap:

- Use central key input listener

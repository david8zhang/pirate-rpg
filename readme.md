# Avast!

A top down pirate themed survival/crafting game build using Phaser 3

## Bugs to fix

- Ship sprite sometimes incorrectly depth sorted

## Must haves for Alpha release:

- Enable player to swim
- Enemies which can control ships
- Procedurally generated content
  - Map generation
  - Random mob placement based on maps
- UI menus
- Saving a game
- Updated text for all inventory items
- Ability to drop items from inventory

## Nice to Have Features (after Alpha release):

- Armor (Head, Chest, Feet)
- Ranged weapons
- Make rowboats + tents have health
- Make structures removable
- Sails
  - Sails unfurling animations

## Technical Debt Roadmap:

- Extract components out of Transport class for reusability (Land detection, movement, etc.)

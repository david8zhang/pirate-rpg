# Avast!

A top down pirate themed RPG game build using Phaser 3

## TODO:

Roadmap:

- Hills, mountains, etc.

  - Colliding with a ladder toggles an "outer" collider and and "inner" collider

- Armor (Head, Chest, Feet)
- Refactor mobs to be dynamically instantiated
- Refactor mob / layer collisions (too many colliders)
- Refactor structure / layer collisions
